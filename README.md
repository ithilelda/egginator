# Egginator

  Throw eggs to capture creatures. It just works <sup>TM</sup>.
  
## Feature
- throw an egg at a living entity to capture it.
- starting 1.1.0, you can configure what can/can't be captured by the eggs.
- starting 1.1.0, using spawn egg made by my mod at a spawner block will spawn exact copies of the captured entity.
- starting 1.1.0, you can use the anvil to upgrade the spawn egg to increase spawner properties such as delay, spawn count etc.
- Example config is provided by default in the config directory named egginator.yaml.
